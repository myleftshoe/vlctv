In Mansfield, he travels on a railway line resurrected by popular demand after falling victim to Beeching's cuts, then heads to Worksop where he learns about the burrowing activities of an eccentric duke. Michael's next stop is 'railway city' - Doncaster, where, in the 19th century, thousands laboured to build trains and where in the 20th century, rail workers shaped British political history. Last stop on this journey is Leeds, where Michael auditions at the Venus and Venice of Variety on the stage at Britain's oldest continuously working music hall.",

After visiting a farm running shorthorn cattle, Adam heads to the coast to experience another New Zealand tradition, the 'bach', a modest holiday shack. A dish of roast Shorthorn beef with kawakawa on the deck overlooking the ocean is a perfect end to his North Island trip.",

The vegetable beds they laid out together are now a mass of leafy winter greens, and the citrus grove is thriving. They decide to harvest what they can as starting point for a huge community cook-up they've got planned, but they'll need more food to feed the hungry throng.
