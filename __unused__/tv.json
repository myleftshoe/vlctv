        "desc": "Danielle heads south to Lockhart, the birthplace of Texas barbecue. First up is Smitty's Market, a beloved old building that serves up traditional German-style barbecue, which means smoked sausage. After that, Danielle hits up the famous Kreuz Market. Everything about this place is massive - the dining room, the barbecue pits and the portions of pork spare ribs, beans, German potato salad, sauerkraut, and their kickin' new jalapeno cheese sausage. At Kreuz, sauce is not allowed. They believe the meat should stand on its own, and it sure does. Next up is Black's BBQ, the oldest family-owned barbecue joint in Texas. They claim to be the first barbecue joint to put brisket on the menu, but these days they are getting buzz for the giant beef ribs which is what Danielle is here to try. Lastly, it's time to leave Lockhart and dip a bit further south where the roots of Texas barbecue are Spanish. Danielle and her old friend, Robert, take apart a cow head and separate the meat used for Barbacoa. Robert samples the cow's less desirable pieces like the eyeballs and tongue. Danielle sticks to her favourites - crispy beef, tacos, carnitas and, of course, the cow cheek meat used for Barbacoa.",

Danielle sits in at a live auction, meets some real-life cowboys and talks to the auctioneer who gives her a lesson in 'auction talk.' After that, it's off to Leo's BBQ: an old, converted gas station that churns out smoked bologna, hot links, and their famous strawberry banana cake. This place has it all. The charm, the service, the flavour. It fills up quickly, but worth the wait. The last stop in Oklahoma is Van's Pig Stand, the oldest barbecue joint in Oklahoma.
